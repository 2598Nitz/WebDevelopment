  <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Definition of Eye Tracking</h2>
  <p id = "floatl">
    Eye tracking refers to the process of measuring where we look, also known as our point of gaze.
    These measurements are carried out by an eye tracker, that records the position of the eyes and the movements they make.
    Eye tracking records our point of gaze and our eye movements in relation to the environment and is typically based on
    the optical tracking of corneal reflections, known as pupil center corneal reflection (PCCR).
    Near-infrared light is directed towards the center of the eyes (pupil), causing visible reflections in the cornea
     (outer-most optical element of the eye). These reflections – the vector between the cornea and the pupil – are tracked by an infrared camera.
